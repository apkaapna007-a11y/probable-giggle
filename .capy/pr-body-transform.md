# NelsonGPT — Transform Zola into a pediatric clinical companion

This PR rebrands and transforms the Zola chat app into NelsonGPT, a specialized pediatric clinical decision support assistant powered by Mistral with a future-ready RAG architecture.

## Why
- Provide a focused, evidence-informed assistant for pediatrics with Clinical and Academic modes.
- Simplify provider logic to a single, secure path (Mistral) and prepare for RAG with Supabase vectors.

## Summary of changes
- Branding: replace all “Zola” references with “NelsonGPT”; new metadata, icons, and cover assets.
- Package/env: update package name/description; add `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DESCRIPTION`, keep Supabase envs; slim provider keys to Mistral only.
- AI integration: remove multi-provider selection at runtime; consolidate models to Mistral; lay groundwork for RAG.
- API/Chat: preserve Vercel AI SDK streaming path while using Mistral models; error handling retained.
- UI: replace Model Selector with Clinical/Academic Mode toggle; pediatric-focused suggestions and system prompt.
- Settings: simplify to Mistral API key (BYOK) and keep appearance/general settings; remove legacy provider toggles.
- Auth: preserve Supabase auth and middleware.
- Assets: add `nelson-logo.png`, `cover_nelsongpt.png`, favicon.
- Docs: rewrite README to NelsonGPT setup and usage.

## Notes
- RAG phase is planned next (Supabase vectors + LangChain/LangGraph) — current PR is provider swap + branding + mode UX.
- Build tested and dependencies installed; dev server runs locally with `npm run dev` after env setup.

## Checklist
- [x] NelsonGPT branding throughout
- [x] Clinical/Academic toggle in chat
- [x] Mistral path active; old providers removed from UI
- [x] Supabase auth intact
- [x] README and env example updated
